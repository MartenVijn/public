<h3>Experience</h3>

<ul><li><p>2014 - current :: Divider B.V.
Here I have role as Linux Engineer using Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat, Centos and Solaris systems runnig on hardware and Xen virtualisation. As part of the devops team I am forfilling the role of deploying and maining platforms on a large scale using Ansible and other tools. Administration covers legacy maintaince aswel automated deployments. I am also one of the designers of a pilot for a IoT platform to monitor power outages using KPN&#39;s LoRaWan IoT network. For logging and monitoring I have recent experiance with Zabbix, syslog, Logstash/Elasticsearch/Kibana and the use enterprise message brokers like Mosquitto and RabbitMQ. I am getting more an more familiar to use python for connectors,parsers and api scripts. I write shell scripts for several common tasks in the unix landscape. I have good network skills.  </p></li><li><p>2012 - current :: Stichting MakerSpace Leiden
MakerSpace Leiden is a community driven, not-for-profit foundation providing workshops, tools and a social network for about 50 makers in de Leiden area. Besides administrating the makerspace infrastructure like servers (FreeBSD/Debian), networks, wifi and LoRaWan, I give workshops in arduino programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and metalworking. I am one the driving forces in the Leiden Maker community finding ways to get things to work for the community. I am also a founder and chairman of the foundation. As a member I make things like lamps, geodesic domes, IoT sensors and actuators.</p></li><li><p>2010-2014 :: ISSC, Leiden University
Migration of smaller departments to central facilities, working on long term solutions based on open source and standards. Learing how to to operate in a large IT invironment and evolving to ITIL3, Prince2 and Togaf enterpise architecture.</p></li><li><p>2007-2010 :: Mathematical Institute, Leiden University
I designed, developed and implemented projects like: improving remote administration, a configuration and change management system, a layered security model. I introduced new technologies for the current high availability setup. Recent projects are a highly scalable desktop environment on Ubuntu Linux and a user satisfaction review. Daily tasks are the administration of 450 user accounts, (wireless) network, firewalls, 30 servers, 150 desktops using Linux and FreeBSD. I have set up a wiki server with documentation for administrators and users. I have organised a workshop on maintenance FreeBSD and NanoBSD for colleagues. </p></li><li><p>2006-2008 :: Space Research Nederland 
Here I redesigned and deployed a mailserver setup to improve performance and decrease the amount of servers. I introduced a
software version control system and a collaboration platform for colleagues. Daily tasks are the administration of 60 desktops
and 30 servers on Debian Linux, backups, software and hardware updates.</p></li><li><p>2000-2002 :: Cultural Center de X

My expertise is mainly in the treatment of brain damage and lower limb amputation.</p></li></ul>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul><li><p>2012 - current :: Internet of Things
Playing with and building IoT infrastructures using LoRaWan and WiFi, opening doors and enlightening workplaces. </p></li><li><p>2010-2011 :: RepRap 3D-printing
A group of 5 technians work on the RepRap project to build self replicating 3D-printers.
My roles are organising, (re-)designing on impacting group processes to attchief a flow of progress and successes. I learn a lot
about hardware, extrusion proceses, embedded software (arduino) and electronics (atmel, stepper drivers and pcb-debugging).
I am also involved in financial aspects and online documentation.</p></li><li><p>2008-2010 :: Network Event Kit (NEK)
is a mobile network kit to deploy wireless network for events up to 1000 people, it
is funded by NLnet. It is based on open source software and I do the design and development. Current development heads
towards an open source wireless controller.</p></li><li><p>2005-2012 :: Open Community Camp (OCC)
is a yearly camp for open source technicians. I am one of the founders and
organisers of the OCC. We create a place to work and learn on a non-for-profit basis for about 70 people. My roles are chairman of the foundation, the planning and organisation, public relations, the speaker program, wireless network and giving workshops.</p></li><li><p>2001-2006 :: Wireless Leiden
